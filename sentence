The origin of Islam is placed around 610 CE when Muhammad a highly spiritual and religious man who spent months in praying and self contemplation in a secluded cave near the town of Mecca is thought to have received divine messages The story is that one morning Muhammad heard the voice of the angel Gabriel and through him Allah spoke words of wisdom The words were first recited by Muhammad later his disciples and then recorded as text which came to known as the Holy Qur'an Thus followers of Islam consider the Qur'an not the work of Muhammad but as direct revelations from Allah Islam which literally means “submission ” was founded on the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad as an expression of surrender to the will of Allah The Qur'an the sacred text of Islam contains the teachings of the Prophet that were revealed to him from Allah Traditional Muslims believe that Allah is the one true God with no partner or equal and that the inspiration of this belief system comes straight from God and the vehicle chosen by him to deliver these teaching to the general population the Prophet Muhammad Muhammad is said to have returned from the cave a changed man The first person he preached to on his return was his wife Khadija who became the first disciple of this new religion Muhammad encouraged by this began to preach the revelations to the public at large through his sermons Many people were impressed by verses of the Qur'an and converted to Islam out of their free will However since the growing popularity of Islam jeopardized Muhammad's and his disciples lives the entire community moved from Mecca to Medina circa 622 CE This move became a crucial event in the history of Islam and came to be known as Hijra The Muslim calendar begins with the day of this migration The people of Medina accepted Islam with and the spread of this new religion gained momentum Later with well organized finances and a vast army Muhammad conquered and converted Mecca as well He did not stop here but sent numerous emissaries to different parts of Arabia Today Islam remains one of the most flourishing religions in the world it is the second largest with around 23% of the earth's population identifying as Muslim The main teaching in the Qur'an is the belief in Allah the one and true God The followers of Islam are traditionally divided into two main branches the Sunni and Shia Each group although they follow the same religion interpret certain events and teachings of Islam differently Humanism means to me I've got the opportunity To realize that I am free To take responsibility To me it doesn't seem so odd That many people pray to God Whenever they are feeling low It's just the way they have to go But when I do not know the way I do not feel the need to pray I use my brain to figure out What the problem's all about I'm grateful that I have my eyes To see the beauty of the skies I'm glad I have my ears to hear The voices of my friends so dear But best of all my brains the one That figures out what must be done To help me run a better race To make the world a better place Not everyone accepted God's message transmitted through Muhammad Even in his own clan there were those who rejected his teachings and many merchants actively opposed the message The opposition however merely served to sharpen Muhammad's sense of mission and his understanding of exactly how Islam differed from paganism The belief in the Oneness of God was paramount in Islam from this all else follows The verses of the Quran stress God's uniqueness warn those who deny it of impending punishment and proclaim His unbounded compassion to those who submit to His will They affirm the Last Judgment when God the Judge will weigh in the balance the faith and works of each man rewarding the faithful and punishing the transgressor Because the Quran rejected polytheism and emphasized man's moral responsibility in powerful images it presented a grave challenge to the worldly Meccans instead of two chocolate doughnuts and a coffee that's more cream than anything else opt for eggs fruit and for a beverage like skimmed milk fresh orange juice or tea The healthier and filling your breakfast is the

years Maybe on a beach working remote while drinking your favorite cocktail or beer Or maybe you'll be sitting on a couch watching Netflix and still dreaming Your success lies in your hands I could tell you all the things you need to do to be successful and at first you'll probably do a couple of those things but six months from now you'll be back to your current routine So do you want to finally figure out how to be successful and do it Or do you want to keep dreaming about it If you're serious about becoming successful keep reading Want to start your path to to success with your own business Find cool products to sell on Handshake your wholesale one stop shop Success in life is whatever you define it to be Maybe for you you want to determine how to be successful to achieve financial freedom or a flexible work schedule Some may want to travel the world while others just want to pursue what they're passionate about Being successful isn't necessarily about being rich or winning awards it can be also about personal fulfillment If you had to design your perfect day what would it look like Would you be sitting on a bench next to a lake writing your memoir Do you imagine yourself climbing Mount Kilimanjaro and taking that big deep breath once you get to the top Or maybe you just want to spend an entire day playing with your kids Why you want to learn how to be successful in life will be personal to you Your partner parents and friends may have their own definition of success But their definitions aren't for you Whatever it is that'll make you feel fulfilled and happy is what you need to focus on while mastering the art of becoming a success Most people obsess over how to be successful because we all want to feel like we matter Without achieving any success we might look back on our life disappointed by our lack of impact on the world Striving to achieve a greater purpose is what keeps us fighting to survive and grow While you might not become an international success your life can still have an impact on others The goal of achieving success will help you live a more purposeful life by pushing you to overcome obstacles work a bit harder and pursue happiness Truth is you'll probably never become successful I'm not saying this to be a jerk I'm saying it because the odds are stacked against you On the bright side it's never been easier to learn how to be successful There's never been more millionaires in the world than there are today Also I'm kind of hoping that by telling you you'll never be successful that you'll think to yourself ‘Man this Nicole girl is kind of a jerk I want to prove her wrong just so I can leave a nasty comment telling her a few months from now that she was SO wrong about me Do it Prove me wrong In my career I've found having a chip on my shoulder and being angry at the world has resulted in me growing at a faster rate than everyone else I like to pretend that I'm the biggest failure in the world with everything to prove If someone doubts me I do whatever it takes to prove them wrong Like I always say ‘Don't piss me off because when I'm angry I'll always win But truth is I secretly love it when people diss me Nothing will motivate you better than a fuming rage deep inside you So here's your diss You spend way too much time on unimportant tasks while pretending that you're ‘researching or learning or finding motivation But truth is you're slacking And you're never going to get your act together unless you START WORKING So if you want to be able to pay your bills or travel the world it's not going to happen if you never take that first step The silver bullet is that you need to put in the work everyday for years It's not some Facebook ads hack Or some magical $2000 conference But no matter how many times people tell you that you're still going to dig around for the secret answer Why Because you don't want to put in the work You want to be an overnight success Not gonna happen though So if I were you I'd start creating And you're wondering why you still haven't made it Your goal isn't actionable And quite frankly it isn't that motivating either Money is great and all but it won't leave you fulfilled What's your big life purpose Maybe being successful to you means taking action to clean the world's oceans or to help prevent animals from becoming extinct Now how do you do that Well you need money and that's where your money goal comes into play How much money do you need to help solve those problems Get a calculator reach out to some nonprofits and start crunching numbers Then use that exact number as your goal And add an exact date to it If you're looking for ways to be successful in life you're not going to find it in the people around you Unless everyone around you is a giant success Your mom dad best friend partner and dog don't need to approve your business ideas Live life your way Stop looking to others for validation that you're on the right track Wanna know how you're on the right track When you ask yourself ‘Am I living the life I want If the answer is yes you're on the right track If the answer is no you've got some changes to make Don't let outsiders cloud your thinking People always think they know what's best for you But only you'd know what that is Trust yourself a bit more and you'll realize you know what you're doing Being successful in life isn't about a magical moment when everything falls into place It's about the little moments in between Moments where you're happy Moments that you're really soaking in Truth is you can experience those moments even if you're currently stuck in a 9 to 5 If your goal is to run an online business you've got evenings and weekends where you can start plugging away Maybe you want to be a digital nomad you can talk to your boss about working remote for three weeks while you work abroad I know what you're thinking you want it all and you want it now But truth is unless you take those baby steps you won't really know whether it's something you want or something you think you want You can still start trying to figure out a plan on how to be successful whether you're at a 9 to 5 or not I'm not saying stay at your 9 to 5 if you're miserable I'm just saying that the 9 to 5 on its own isn't always the only cause of your frustration or unhappiness There's nothing wrong with mentorship It can actually be really great for building your career Most people don't want mentorship though they want someone to do all the work for them Entrepreneurship and being successful is all about taking ownership You talk a big game about wanting freedom but when it comes to designing your first store you ask for so much feedback But what you need to realize is that the best thing about entrepreneurship is that you can create your business any way you want And if you get a mentor to help you make decisions it's basically like having a boss oversee your work – you start to lose that freedom that you really wanted If you constantly have people guiding you on your journey your wins aren't really your wins and your losses aren't really your losses If you don't take ownership of your wins and losses you never really get that ‘OMG I DID IT feeling And you also never learn from your mistakes because they weren't your mistakes in the first place You're going to make bad decisions but you'll make some great ones too You don't need a mentor to teach you how to be successful especially if your goal is to live life on your own terms For Those Not Yet Convinced Islam claims to be the true way to God What makes one religion valid over other ideologies is the proofs it offers for its truthfulness Hence one needs to look at these proofs weigh them and take an informed decision One needs to be sincere in one's endeavour and above all seek the help of the Almighty to guide him/her to the right path If a person is still not convinced of the truthfulness of Islam then he/she can further look at the proofs Islam offers Islam offers overwhelming proofs of its truthfulness and is the only religion that completely appeals to common sense Some of the proofs Islam offers are the scientific proofs in the Quran the miracles performed by the Prophet Muhammad and the prophesies of his coming in previous scriptures the foretold events mentioned in the Quran that later came to pass
