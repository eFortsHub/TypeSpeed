{"value":"i've found having a chip on my shoulder and being angry at the world has resulted in me growing at a faster rate than everyone else i like to pretend that i'm the biggest failure in the world with everything to prove if someone doubts me i do whatever it takes to prove them wrong like i always say ‘don't piss me off because when i'm angry i'll always win but truth is i secretly love it when people diss me nothing will motivate you better than a fuming rage deep inside you so here's your diss you spend way too much time on unimportant tasks while pretending that you're ‘researching or learning or finding motivation but truth is you're slacking and you're never going to get your act together unless you start working so if you want to be able to pay your bills or travel the world it's not going to happen if you never take that first step the silver bullet is that you need to put in the work everyday for years it's not some facebook ads hack or some magical $2000 conference but no matter how many times people tell you that you're still going to dig around for the secret answer why because you don't want to put in the work you want to be an overnight success not gonna happen though so if i were you i'd start creating and you're wondering why you still haven't made it your goal isn't actionable and quite frankly it isn't that motivating either money is great and all but it won't leave you fulfilled what's your big life purpose maybe being successful to you means taking action to clean the world's oceans or to help prevent animals from becoming extinct now how do you do that "}
