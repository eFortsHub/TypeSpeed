{"value":"and true god the followers of islam are traditionally divided into two main branches the sunni and shia each group although they follow the same religion interpret certain events and teachings of islam differently humanism means to me i've got the opportunity to realize that i am free to take responsibility to me it doesn't seem so odd that many people pray to god whenever they are feeling low it's just the way they have to go but when i do not know the way i do not feel the need to pray i use my brain to figure out what the problem's all about i'm grateful that i have my eyes to see the beauty of the skies i'm glad i have my ears to hear the voices of my friends so dear but best of all my brains the one that figures out what must be done to help me run a better race to make the world a better place not everyone accepted god's message transmitted through muhammad even in his own clan there were those who rejected his teachings and many merchants actively opposed the message the opposition however merely served to sharpen muhammad's sense of mission and his understanding of exactly how islam differed from paganism the belief in the oneness of god was paramount in islam from this all else follows the verses of the quran stress god's uniqueness warn those who deny it of impending punishment and proclaim his unbounded compassion to those who submit to his will they affirm the last judgment when god the judge will weigh in the balance the faith and works of each man rewarding the faithful and punishing the transgressor because the quran rejected polytheism and emphasized man's moral responsibility in powerful images it presented a grave challenge to the worldly meccans instead of two chocolate doughnuts and a coffee that's more cream than anything else opt for eggs fruit and for a beverage like skimmed milk fresh orange juice or tea the healthier and filling your breakfast is the more energized you'll feel throughout the day "}
