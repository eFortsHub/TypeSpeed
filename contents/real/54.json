{"value":"steps you won't really know whether it's something you want or something you think you want you can still start trying to figure out a plan on how to be successful whether you're at a 9 to 5 or not i'm not saying stay at your 9 to 5 if you're miserable i'm just saying that the 9 to 5 on its own isn't always the only cause of your frustration or unhappiness there's nothing wrong with mentorship it can actually be really great for building your career most people don't want mentorship though they want someone to do all the work for them entrepreneurship and being successful is all about taking ownership you talk a big game about wanting freedom but when it comes to designing your first store you ask for so much feedback but what you need to realize is that the best thing about entrepreneurship is that you can create your business any way you want and if you get a mentor to help you make decisions it's basically like having a boss oversee your work – you start to lose that freedom that you really wanted if you constantly have people guiding you on your journey your wins aren't really your wins and your losses aren't really your losses if you don't take ownership of your wins and losses you never really get that ‘omg i did it feeling and you also never learn from your mistakes because they weren't your mistakes in the first place you're going to make bad decisions but you'll make some great ones too you don't need a mentor to teach you how to be successful especially if your goal is to live life on your own terms for those not yet convinced islam claims to be the true way to god what makes one religion valid over other ideologies is the proofs it offers for its truthfulness hence one needs to look at these proofs weigh them and take an informed decision one needs to be sincere in one's endeavour and above all seek the help of the almighty "}
